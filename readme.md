# All Changed Merged to main Kijai nodes - Do Not Use

Do not use these nodes any more. Use the nodes at https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-LivePortraitKJ. They are more up to date and have all of the MPS support code now.

# MPS Notes from Grant

If you wish to incorporate these changes into your repo, feel free to open an issue and ask. The commits should be pretty clear, and I also label almost all changes with #HACK so a full text search will work too. 

Please let me know if you decide to incorporate any of these changes into your LivePortrait implementation so I can direct people to you repository. I do not intend to maintain this repo.

Some operations are simply not supported on MPS and I didn't rewrite them. Most of my changes are just to `.cuda` calls and that sort of thing. Many operations are still done on CPU, so don't expect awesome performance.

On my M1 macbook 32GB it takes around 30 seconds flat + 1 second per video frame. 32 frames is 57 seconds, 600 frames is 650 seconds. VRAM usage is not dependent on video length. I never started using swap, but make sure to open up activity monitor and check if you are on a lower-end model. I'm pretty sure it only took 9 GB VRAM but I didn't profile it carefully.

You may also need to run comfyui with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python main.py` (you can also set the fallback as a env variable in other ways), where main.py is the comfyui file. It's possible that it is not necessary macbooks after M1.

I have converted all the pickle files to safetensors: https://huggingface.co/Kijai/LivePortrait_safetensors/tree/main

They go here (and are automatically downloaded if the folder is not present) `ComfyUI/models/liveportrait`


Insightface is also required.
If you have a working compile encironment, installing it can be as easy as:

`pip install insightface`

or for the portable version, in the ComfyUI_windows_portable -folder:

`python_embeded/python.exe -m pip install insightface`

If this fails (and it's likely), you can check the Troubleshooting part of the reactor node for alternative:

For insightface model, extract this to `ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l`:
